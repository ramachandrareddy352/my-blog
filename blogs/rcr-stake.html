                <h3> >> RCR-STAKE</h3>
                <p>Hello WEB3, In this blog series, we are learning how to build a fixed staking pool. It's a very
                    interesting to say that I have used so make tools and others to build this project with multiple
                    concepts like stable coin, air drops, chainlink data feeds, automation and Verified Random
                    Function(VRF). These are the key functionalities in this project.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Any user can stake some pool accepted collateral for some fixed number of days and earn the
                        rewards for staking as Decentralized Stable Coin(DSC).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These DSC are purchase through the DSCEngine contract also.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DSC tokens are controlled by the DSC Engine contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And also user can register for the airdrop from the DSCAirdrop contract and after every certain
                        period of time chainlink automatically trigger the announce winner function and send the DSC
                        tokens to that winner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During registration for Airdrop protocol takes some amount of registration fess based on the
                        reward amount of that particiular airdrop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In fixed staking pool if user stake the collateral for more period he will get more reward rate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DCS library helps to make calculation for DSCEngine and the calculations are done in
                        <b>assembly</b> languague to reduce the gas fee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Here we used Chainlink data feeds to get the current price of the collateral in the market.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Verified Random Function(VRF)</b> is used to generate the random number for the airdrop
                        winner.
                    </li>
                    <Li>
                        <b>Automation</b> is used to automate the process of airdrop winner announcement.
                    </Li>
                    <li>
                        DSC Engine contract mint the DSC tokens on over collateralization of <b>200%</b> due to avoid
                        the price inflation attack from the protocol.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After completing of staking period of the user, he can able to withdraw the staked and
                        collateral and earn some reward tokesn as DSC tokens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In fixed pool user can able to take flash loan by implementing FlashLoanReceiver contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For any flash loan protocol takes 0.3% as fees, these fees are received by the fee receiver
                        address.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To approve the tokens to spend, protocol accepts gas less approvals by making signature.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>

                    Chainlink Data Feeds provide data that is aggregated from many data sources by a decentralized set
                    of independent node operators. The Decentralized Data Model describes this in detail. However, there
                    are some exceptions where data for a feed can come only from a single data source or where data
                    values are calculated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get the price of the collateral we used chainlink price feeds. For different collaterals we use
                    same AggregatorV3Interface contract and pass the respective price feed address.
                    If chainlink pricefeeds were hacked we use same interface to return price using Uniswap oracle. So
                    in this project we get the price of collateral through calling interface of IPriceOracle.sol
                </p>
                <P>
                    Here is the function code which returns the price of collateral.

                <p>
                    We can see that at line 53, 56 we make some checks regarding to whether the oracle is correctly
                    working or not.

                    <li>
                        At line 53 we check the current roundIds and undated roundIds are correct or not.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At line 56 we are checking for stale timeout error.

                <p>
                    To create a price Orcale using chainlink we have to make subscription and add consumer to that

                    Chainlink Automation is a decentralized automation framework that allows developers to build
                    Automate your smart contracts using a secure and hyper-reliable decentralized network that uses the
                    same external network of node operators that secures billions in value. Building on Chainlink
                    Automation will accelerate your innovation, save you time and money, and help you get to market
                    faster so you don't have to deal with the setup cost, ongoing maintenance, and risks associated with
                    a centralized automation stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To learn more about how the Chainlink Automation Network automates your smart contracts, visit the
                    Concepts and <a href="https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/concepts/automation-architecture"
                        target="_blank">Architecture pages</a>. You can also learn more through our<a

                    Chainlink Automation will reliably execute smart contract functions using a variety of triggers.
                    Explore the examples below to see how Chainlink Automation works for each type of trigger. Before
                    you begin, you will need an active cryptocurrency wallet such as Metamask.
                <ul>
                    <li>Time-based trigger: Use a time-based trigger to execute your function according to a time
                        schedule.</li>
                    <li>Custom logic trigger: Use a custom logic trigger to provide custom solidity logic that
                        Automation Nodes evaluate (offchain) to determine when to execute your function onchain.</li>
                    <li>Log trigger: Use log data as both trigger and input.</li>

                <p>
                    Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator
                    (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or
                    usability. For each request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic
                    proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified onchain before any
                    consuming applications can use it. This process ensures that results cannot be tampered with or
                    manipulated by any single entity including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract
                    developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that rely on unpredictable
                    outcomes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Building blockchain games and NFTs.</li>
                    <li>Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.</li>
                    <li>Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h5>>> Two methods to request randomness</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Subscription</b>: Create a subscription account and fund its balance with either native
                        tokens
                        or LINK. You can then connect multiple consuming contracts to the subscription account. When
                        the consuming contracts request randomness, the transaction costs are calculated after the
                        randomness requests are fulfilled and the subscription balance is deducted accordingly. This
                        method allows you to fund requests for multiple consumer contracts from a single
                        subscription.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Direct funding</b>: Consuming contracts directly pay with either native tokens or LINK
                        when they
                        request random values. You must directly fund your consumer contracts and ensure that there
                        are enough funds to pay for randomness requests.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a
                        specific
                        asset, typically a fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity like gold. They aim to
                        combine
                        the benefits of cryptocurrencies (such as decentralization and security) with the stability of
                        traditional financial assets
                    </p>
                    <h4>>> How do stablecoins work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Stablecoins generally work the same across the board: They are cryptocurrencies minted on a
                        blockchain that users can buy, sell and trade on an exchange just like any other crypto coin.
                        People
                        can store stablecoins in their hot wallets and/or cold storage devices like they would bitcoin
                        or
                        any altcoin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to have integrity, most stablecoins are linked to a reserve of external assets of some
                        kind, whether it be a stash of fiat currency, commodities like gold or debt instruments like
                        commercial paper. In most cases, the company or entity that develops the stablecoin owns
                        reserves
                        equal to the amount of stablecoins it has in circulation. This is such that any stablecoin
                        holder
                        should be able to redeem one stablecoin token for one dollar at any time.
                    </p>

                    <h4>>> The four types of stablecoins</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are four different types of stablecoins, each with its own way of fixing the value of the
                        tokens to a stable figure.
                    </p>
                    <ol>

                    <p>
                        In this project we used Algorithmic Stable coin, this category of stablecoins uses algorithms to
                        modulate the supply based on its market demand. In short, these algorithms automatically burn
                        (permanently remove coins from circulation) or mint new coins based on the fluctuating demand
                        for
                        the stablecoin at any given time.

                    <P>
                        This function is used to stake the tokens by making another transaction for approving the tokens
                        to spend.
                    </P>
                    <dt>stakeWithPermit()</dt>
                    <P>
                        In this function we can make a single transaction for approving and staking by making signature
                        to send tokens for the pool.
                    </P>
                    <dt>redeemCollateral()</dt>
                    <P>
                        This function is used to redeem the collateral from the pool. This is called only after
                        completing after that staking period and after that isRedeemed state is updated to true.
                    </P>
                    <dt>withdrawRewards()</dt>
                    <P>
                        This function is used to withdraw the rewards from the pool. The reward tokens are the DSC
                        tokens.
